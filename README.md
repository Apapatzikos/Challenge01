# Robinhood Case Study

## Overview and Origin

* Name of company
    -   Robihood Markets, Inc.
* When was the company incorporated?
    -  Robinhood was incorporated/founded in 2013 and then introduced as an app in 2015.
* Who are the founders of the company?
    -  Vladimir Tenev and Baiju Bhatt
* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
    - After Vladimir and Baiju graduated, they went to New York and founded 2 finance companies and realized that the big firms on Wall Street were paying almost nothing  to trade stocks while the average American was being charged a commission fee for every transaction. They decided to change that and Robinhood began as a way for everyone to access the financial markets, not just the wealthy.
* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
    -  Robinhood is funded by 87 investors with the 10 main ones being:
              1) Emergent Fidelity Technologies
              2) 9Yards Capital
              3) Sequoia Capital
              4) True Capial Management
              5) New Enterprise Associates
              6) Salesforce Ventures
              7) Bossanova Investimentos
              8) ICONIQ Growth
              9) Rockpool Capital
              10) Friends & Family Capital
    -  The total funding is about 6.2 Billion dollars, after a post-IPO secondary round this has hence increased on May 13, 2022.

## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
    - Lack of access average people had to the financial markets.

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
    - Robinhhod's intended customer is the average person, during the time the app was launched its most likely customer base was Millenials. The average age of a Robinhood user in 2021 is 31 years old while the most concentrated age group was between the ages of 27 and 33 years old.
    - The solution this company offers that their competitors do not is a user-friendly easy-to-access portal to interact/participate in the financial markets with options such as selling stocks, cryptocurrencies, and many others with the most attractive aspect being no commission fees.

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
  - It was easy to find out and confirm what technologies they were using exactly but what I found through stackshare.io and crunch base were the following:
        * Application and Data: Python, React, NGNIC, PostgreSQL, Ubuntu, Redis, Bootstrap, Amazon EC2, Sass, Django, Redux, Kafka, Golang, RabbitMQ, Swift, Kotlin, Memcached, Django REST fram, Airflow, Celery, RxJava, Faust.
        * Utilities: Google Analytics, Elasticsearch, Retrofit.
        * DevOps: Git, GitHub, Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, Webpack, Babel, Terraform, Kibana, Grafana, Sentry, Longstash, Vagrant, Prometheus, Consul, Zookeeper, ELK, Vault, Fabric, Salt, StatsD, Phabricator, Sensu, LXC.
        * Business Tools: Slack, G Suite, Confluence Asana.

  - For the uses and implementation of the technology, it would most likely be : Cloud Services, Mobile App Development, Payment Processing, Data Storage and Processing, Security Technologies, Microservices Architecture, and Backend development.
